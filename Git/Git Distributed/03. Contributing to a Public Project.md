# Contributing to a Public Project: Fork
You cannot commit to the oublic projects using `git commit`. If you want to contribute to a public project, first you need to fork the project in your repository. On the repository page on github, on the top and right side of the page, you may find the option fork. Then, clone the forked repository into your local machine.
Remember to **add a new branch other than the main branch** to push your changes.
The next step is to create a pull request in the repo page on github. You can write a proposal to add to your PR.
People who review the PRs can either add comments on your codes and ask for more changes, or accept or reject your PR.
