# Distributed Workflow
Most of the commands you have learnt till now was a local workflow. Now if you want to take participate in a group project, based on the project concepts, and team memebers and whether the project is open source or closed source, the workflow is different.
## Centralized Workflow
In such a system, there is a central repository to which every developers push and when needed merge, so no body overwrites the project. This workflow usually is utilized in small projects.

## Integration-Manager Workflow
In this system, you work on a big project and the number of developers is high. As a result, the access to the remote repository is not granted to every one. Meanwhile, we need everyone to be able to commit to the repo and fix the bugs.

The project maintainer is the person who manages the repository and is allowed to push to the repository. A contributer pushes the changes to a public copy of the repository, and emails the maintainer aking to pull the changes to the original repository. Then the maintainer can merge contributers repo locally and push it to the main repository.
## Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow
This system works for huge projects with thousands of contributrs. In this case we need hierarchy to mange the repository.

The blessed repo is the main repo of the project. The developers clone the blessed repository. They push the changes to the lieutenants and they push it to the dictators. Lieutenants make a deligaion layer for the project manager to handle the contributers.
