# Branch Management
To check *on which branch* your changes are being commited you should use the following command:
```bash
$ git branch
  dev
* main
  testing
```
---
To check the remote branches you may as well use the following command:
```bash
$ git branch -a
  dev
* main
  testing
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/iss53
  remotes/origin/main
```
---
`git branch -v` shows the last commit made on that branch in addition to the branch name:
```bash
$ git branch -v
  dev     2dfff7a Add Git Branching
* main    acd231e Add merging branches screenchots
  testing 11eef18 Add git branching
```
---
To print more details on branches use `git branch -vv`. This command line also prints out the **remote branch** which keeps tracks of the local branch:
```bash
$ git branch -vv
  dev     2dfff7a Add Git Branching
* main    acd231e [origin/main] Add merging branches screenchots
  testing 11eef18 Add git branching
```
As an example `dev` and `testing` has not been set up to be tracked by `origin/dev`.
***
The next command line is `git branch --merge`. This command line prints the branches that has at least once been merged. On the other hand, `git branch --no-merge` prints out the branches that never has been merged.
```bash
$ git branch --merge
* main
$ git branch --no-merge
  dev
  testing
```
This is spetially useful in case you wan to delete the merged branches. You can also pipe two command lines so that you can delete all of the not merged branches at the same time:
```bash
$ git branch -D | xargs git brnach --no-merged
```
***
The use of these commands is spetially obvious in big projects. Try to keep track of your project branches and manage them regularly to avoid further confusions.
