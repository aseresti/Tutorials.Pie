# Git Branching
Branching means you diverge from your main project to work on some ideas or features without messing with the main line of the project.

As it is shown in the above figure, every commit in git is a node. The Main or Master branch is the main line of your project. Then you might diverge branches to work on some other features and then merge branches once you made sure that the features are working flawlessly.
Branching is the git "killer feature" and it is easy and light weighted. Every commit that is made on git is saved as a graph. Every commit objects inherits from a tree object and each tree object inherits from binary large objects (blob). Let's understand the concept behind each of these objects. In a single commit, you might submit more than one file or even a directory. Git first creats a blob object which is binary file for each of the files. A tree object is responsible for the structure of your project directory and contains the content indication which file names are stored as which blobs. Git then creates a commit object containing the metadata that can re-create the snapshot whenever it is needed.

The next commit that is made has a pointer to the previous commit which is called the parent commit. The initial commit does not have any parent. Some commits have two parents. Merging takes place in these commits.
A branch in Git is a pointer that can move in between commits. If you type `git branch` command in your project repository, the only existing branch is named either `main` or `master`. The name `main` is for those projects that has been cloned from github.
```
$ git branch
* main
```
## Create a New Branch
You can use the `git branch [branch name]` to create a new branch. 
```
$ git branch testing
$ git branch
* main
  testing
```
If you look at the graph of your git repository you can see that the new branch creates a pointer last commit.

However, creating a new branch does not change the Head pointer to the new branch. To change that you need to use `git checkout [branch name]` command line.
Note that if you put the `[file name]` instead of `[branch name]` it will change your file to its last snapshot.
```
$ git checkout testing
Switched to branch 'testing'
$ git branch
  main
* testing
```
If you commit a file now with the testing branch activated, it would be commited under the testing branch and not the main branch.

Also, another useful command is `git checkout -b [branch name]` which creates and checks out to a new branch.
```
$ git checkout -b dev
M	Git/Git Branching/01. Introduction to Branching.md
Switched to a new branch 'dev'
```
Note that when you change the pointer to a branch your files are going to be different. Before changing the pointer to another branch make sure to commit your files so that your untracked files or changes are not missed.
To understand how changes in a single file works on branches, you can create a file and add different lines in a single file while on different branches and commit those changes.
