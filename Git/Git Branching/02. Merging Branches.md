# Merging Branches
Imagine that there was an issue with your code on the project, or you wanted to add some new features to your code. As a result, in order to not mess up the main branch of the project, you create another branch named `iss53`. On that branch the python file for `testing_merging.py` is created. Some commits to the branch is made and now we want to merge this branch with the main branch of the project. Now, let's look at the project repository graph:

We have two scenarios. Scenario number 1 is when you create a branch and change files on the new branch, but the files on the main branch remains untouched. This is called a fast forward merge. In this case we can simply use the `git merge` command to merge the two branches. First you need to checkout to the branch you want to bring the changes in from the other branch:
```
$ git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
$ git merge iss53
Fast-forward
```
Any two branches are able to be merged using this command line. As a result of this command line, the main branch would come forward to the last commit made in the `iss53` branch.

After merging the two branches, it is recommended to delete `iss53` branch as we don't use it anymore. To that, use the following command:
```
$ git branch -d iss53
Deleted branch iss53
```
Note that this command only works in case you have merged the branch already. Otherwise, you need to use `-D` instead in the command line to force delete the branch.
The scenario number 2 is when both of the `main` and `iss53` branches changes in parallel. This means that the two branches are diverged. In this case if you use the `git merge` command, it uses the 'ort' strategy to merge branches. This means git makes a new merge commit that has two parents: one is the last commit from the `main` branch and the other one from `iss53`.
