# Merging Branches
Imagine that there was an issue with your code on the project, or you wanted to add some new features to your code. As a result, in order to not mess up the main branch of the project, you create another branch named `iss53`. On that branch the python file for `testing_merging.py` is created. Some commits to the branch is made and now we want to merge this branch with the main branch of the project. Now, let's look at the project repository graph:

We have some case scenarios. Scenario number 1 is when you create a branch and change files on the new branch, but the files on the main branch remains untouched. This is called a fast forward merge. In this case we can simply use the `git merge` command to merge the two branches. First you need to checkout to the branch you want to bring the changes in from the other branch:
```
$ git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
$ git merge iss53
Fast-forward
```
Any two branches are able to be merged using this command line. As a result of this command line, the main branch would come forward to the last commit made in the `iss53` branch.

After merging the two branches, it is recommended to delete `iss53` branch as we don't use it anymore. To that, use the following command:
```
$ git branch -d iss53
Deleted branch iss53
```
Note that this command only works in case you have merged the branch already. Otherwise, you need to use `-D` instead in the command line to force delete the branch.
The scenario number 2 is when both of the `main` and `iss53` branches changes in parallel. This means that the two branches are diverged.In `iss54` we are changing `testing_merge.py` . In this case if you use the `git merge` command, and the `main` branch changes the `02.Merging Branches.md`. In this case, git uses the 'ort' strategy to merge branches. This means git makes a new merge commit that has two parents: one is the last commit from the `main` branch and the other one from `iss54`.

In this case, the merging was easy because the changes were isolated from each others. 
The third case scenarios happens when on both of the branches we are working on the same file.

In this case if we merge the two branches, it would give us an error:
```
$ git merge iss55
Auto-merging Git/testing_merging.py
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in Git/testing_merging.py
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
The conflict error here indicates that there are some conflict in the file, and by default, git does not know which one of the commits it should take to add on the file on merged branch. Therefore, it asks us to first resolve the conflicts and then commit it.
If you look back to the file that the conflict occures there, you can see that git already points out the lines of conflict on the file:
![Alt text](<../Images/Screen Shot 2023-09-04 at 8.17.24 PM.png>)
Note that the charachters are made by git and different text editors run a shows it in different styles.
The key characteristics of the git raise of conflict is that it shows the lines that are changed in the current branch and the lines that are supposed to replace them as a result of merging.
To "resolve the conflict" all you need to do is to remove the characters added by git showing the conflict, and also you may edit the code as you wish. As an example in this case I needed to keep both of the changes that was made in each of the branches.

In this case if we check the status of the git, we can see that there as `unmerged path` status added:
```
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
	both modified:   Git/testing_merging.py

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   Git/Git Branching/02. Merging Branches.md
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
Git suggests to resolve the conflict and commit the resolved file to the repo or use the `git merge --abort` command line to take the status back to before merging two branches. Whenever you resolved the conflict you need to add and commit the file to your repository. When you add the file git updates the status as all conflicts fixed and you need to commit the update to conclude the merge.
```
$ git add Git/testing_merging.py
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:
	modified:   Git/testing_merging.py

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   Git/Git Branching/02. Merging Branches.md
$ git commit -m "Resolved conflict in merging branches"
[main c622d4f] Resolved conflict in merging branches
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 3 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   Git/Git Branching/02. Merging Branches.md
```

The fourth case scenario is that you are working on more than one file on each of your branches. If you are working on more than one file but the conflict only happens in one file, when you merge branches, all of those files that are not a source of conflict are added with no issue and you only will get a conflict error in the one that was changed in both of the branches. You need to follow the same way to resolve the conflict.
## `git push` and `git pull`
`git push -u origin main` 
`git push` uploads the changes and files from your local repo to the remote repo, while `git pull` does the opposite action of downloading files from remote to the local repo. Technically `git pull` means that you are merging the two branches of remote and local repository. If it was possible, it does a fast forward or might need to solve the conflict.
