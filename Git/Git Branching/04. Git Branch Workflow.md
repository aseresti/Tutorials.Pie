# Branching WorkFlow
Brnaching makes some workflows possible in the project development cycle. In this section we will cover these workflows:
## Long-running Branches
In some cases, you are the only one who is commiting into the repository. In this case, usually there is a `main` branch and some `proposed` or `update` branches that are being checked out to develop some features and merged back to `main` whenever you need it. When you are dealing with a large project spetially, having a long-running branch seems helpfull a lot.
## Topic Branches
You might also work in big projects that a lot of developers commit to that, as a result in case of any developement you might create several branches. Note that whenever you merged a topic branch into your `main` branch, delete the topic branch afterwards.
> In general when you are working on git, commit often so you don't lose any changes.

It is recommended to use a representative name for your branches, so you would understand what was the goal of making that branch in the first place, like `bug-fixes` or use your name to specify the branch like `aseresti/fix-bug` in big projects.
