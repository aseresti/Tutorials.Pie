# Working with Remotes
As it was already mentioned, we have a local repository and a remote repository on Git. Everything on git is distributed which means until you don't want to share your changes in the project, you can work offline on your local repository. Remote repository is on a server shared between the contributers to the project.
To create the remote repository you need to create it on one of the hosting servers. Github is one of the popular hosting servers. You can create a project on Github by simply naming the repository, making it public/private, adding README.md, .gitignore, and LISENCE.
Now you might either clone the repository into your local working directory, or merge it with an existing repository.
## Creating a new repository on the command line
You need to copy the https or ssh url of the repository and use `git clone <url>` to create the new repository.
## Push an existing local repository from the Command Line
If you want to check if there is any remote repository connected to your local repository use the command line `git remote`.
To push your existing repository to a remote repository use `git remote add RepoNAME <repo url>`. The remote repo name that is usually used here is called origin. Now if you use a `git remote` in your cammand line, it will output the origin.
```$ git remote
origin```
To gain more information about the remote repository use
```$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/aseresti/python-tutorials.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/aseresti/python-tutorials.git (push)```
This command line shows what remote repository would be used to fetch from or push to.
You can have several remotes with different names and the same url. In some projects this might happen that you want to push your project into different repositories such as a website host that has its own remote repo.
```$git remote add Ana https://github.com/aseresti/python-tutorials.git
$ git remote -v
Ana	https://github.com/aseresti/python-tutorials.git (fetch)
Ana	https://github.com/aseresti/python-tutorials.git (push)
origin	https://github.com/aseresti/python-tutorials.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/aseresti/python-tutorials.git (push)
$ git remote
Ana
origin```
To remove a remote repository from your local use the following command line:
```$ git remote remove Ana
$ git remote
origin ```
To update your local repository with the remote repository and add all of the branches, tags, etc; you can use `git fetch reponame`. Note that first you need to add the other repository using `git remote reponame <url>`. You can use `git branch -a` to check if the branches from the other repository has been added to your local repository.
