# Tagging
Tgging is the ability of specifying a certain point in the history to mark a certain point that you want to release a stable version of your work like version 1.0 (v1.0).
To list the git tags you can use `git tag`
To create a tag on your last version, you can use `git tag [tag_name]` such as `git tag v1.0`.
Now the tag that you have created must appear on your history log.
```
$ git tag
$ git tag v1.0
$ git tag
v1.0
$ git log -1

As a result we have added a tag to the last made commit. However, this "light weight" tag does not indicate any specific information. To have an annotated tag we need to use a `-a` to add a message to describe the tag as well. `git tag v1.2 -a` as a result of this command a new window gets input the tag message. You may also use 
```
git tag -a v1.2 -m "pre-release for new software"
```
You can use `git show [tag-name]` to get the information on the tag information.
```
$ git show v1.2
tag v1.2

You can also create an annotated tag this way:
```
$ git tag [tag-name] -a -m "[tag-message]" <commit-id>
```
The point of adding a tag is that to be appeared on remote repository, so other people can see the stable releases on you repoitory. Therefore, these tags should be pushed on the remote repository.
Note that the light weight tag is for your personal use to add a check point on your log history.
To push a tag on your remote repository use `git push [remote-name] [tag]`:
```
$ git push origin v1.2

 * [new tag]         v1.2 -> v1.2
```
To push all tags at the same time you should use `git push origin --tag`
To create a new release to your project, on your github repository you can find Releases section at the right side of the page. By clicking on the new release you can select an existing tag as your release and add a description for that.

Change log is where you should describe the differences between your current release and previous one. After releasing the selected version it would be accessible under the release section of your repository and one can download .zip and tar.gz files of the source code.

To delete all of the tags at the same time you can create a tunnel on terminal command:
```
$ git tag | xargs git tag --delete
Deleted tag 'v0.9' (was 78809e3)
Deleted tag 'v1.0' (was 69542a8)
Deleted tag 'v1.2' (was 3b1311d)
```
You can also delete the pushed tags and releases manually on the remote repository.
